1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a library that helps show data through a virtual DOM. If a data in React changes, then React will only change the specific data and not everything else with the least amount of process to get there. It helps smooth UI accessibility and makes updating data easier without putting too much pressure on the browser.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

To think in react is to see how to break down the information you want to show into UI components and make structure it well to render out. There are a fews steps to follow. First you want to break down each information into an example layout of how you want the app to look like. Second, you make a component heiarchy of the UI you have in your app. Then you build a static version with the required amount of representation of the UI state. Next, you link the part of the UI that needs to be updated frequently. Finally you add data into your UI to see it render on the app.
